## About

Tuned Global is a music translation service that operates globally and our group was tasked with creating an api that could automate
the adding of new translations. This would enable tuned global abstract the configuration of terms

Our client needed a multi-tiered project management setup which is a project that could support multiple clients that each individually
had translations. The task at hand would be to write a HTTP endpoint that could recieve new translations from the master project (multi-tiered project)
and synchronise that with the clients by adding the new terms onto the client projects
